About
Hi, I'm Prab!
I'm an aspiring software engineer and a second year BEng Computing student at Imperial College London.
I have a strong interest into Machine Learning and Distributed Systems, with a focus on back-end development. My main languages are Java and Python. As part of studies and interest, I have also experimented with C, Haskell and Kotlin.
This personal website outlines some of my past and on-going projects and experiences over the last few years. My CV is linked below, but you can find more details on my work lower down.
Feel free to get in touch with me via Email, or send me a message on LinkedIn!
