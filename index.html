                            <p>
                                Given a Raspberry-Pi which was based off of the same ARM architecture, we were first tasked as a group of 4 to create an emulator that could execute the instructions given in the format of a binary file which covered the whole range of processing, data-transferring,
                                and branching instructions. The program utilised a multi-stage pipeline operating on an anonymous union of structs (representing the current instruction). Thus the instructions had to be initially parsed, and then executed
                                according to flags and register shifts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The assembler used a similar format to represent each instruction and operated using a multi-pass method as to be able to calculate memory locations. The hardest task was being able to parse the given strings of assembly instructions and tokenise them,
                                in order to parse them correctly to the correct binary representation (making sure to also set the correct flags and register calculations).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the extension we quickly created a simple game of Connect-Four. We then added in functionality to display the game on a custom PCB and hand-made LED-matrix. I also decided to implement a "Computer" to play against, and decided to use the Monte Carlo
                                Search Tree algorithm in order to traverse the current decision space for each move the computer made. Once implemented, even at just 10,000 iterations, it remained unbeatable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All of the tasks ran on the Raspberry-Pi and so we made sure to optimise for speed and heavily reduce memory usage. With manual data-allocation and freeing, we were able to reduce our memory usage significantly, as well as by making use of data structures
                                such as anonymised unions rather than having several unused struct members.

                                Inspired by the confusing number of tasks and assignments we were face during our time at school and university, decided to create an aid to help schedule time to complete those tasks, keep reminders on upcoming assessments, as well as serve as a platform
                                to discuss those assignments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Messaging would work in threads, similar to the structure built into Slack, and would allow messages to contain text content or for a file to be uploaded and sent. Each assignment and/or module would contain its own channel for sake of organising chats
                                and streamlining the process of effectively spreading and receiving information relating to a certain assignment. This would be more effective than questions being lost in random conversation of large, generic group chats.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was familiar with Android Studio, and so built the user-facing UI and also handled the parsing of data from JSON to usable data, that would be sent to and recieved from the server.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The server was able to store users and link them to certain channels, threads and messages. It also handled creation and authentication of users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, despite both front and back-end having working data-parsing functionality, the app was unable to connect to the endpoint given the methods we had tried in the time constraints.

                                Project developed as part of my Computer Science A-Level, during which I had lea rnt to work with Python. With my idea for the project I decided to take it upon myself to learn a new language to work with as researching graphical interfaces with Python
                                yielded not many simple solutions to migrate to a mobile platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus after market research and analysis of implementation options, I had three main possibilities: iOS application using Swift, Android application using Java, a web-based application. Due to unfamiliarity with web-based platforms at the time, and no
                                permanent developer access to an Apple &trade; device, I decided to use Android Studio and learn how to develop with Java. Additionally, it gave me the opportunity to work with a more traditional object-orientated programming
                                language.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I made extensive use of the Android documentation and some third-party libraries for tasks such as visualising graphs. Furthermore, I self-taught myself the structure and concepts of databases, including how to create, manage and query a database stored
                                on-device on Android with SQLite.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the project was complete, I wrote an extensive documentation docuemnt on each section of the code, detailing the function of each class, method, or code snippets. Lastly, I wrote an evaluation report outlining constructive criticism of my own work,
                                shortcomings and possible improvements and future features.

                            <p>
                                After being introduced to the concept of Machine Learning and biologically-influenced computational techniques, I immediately took an interest into the topic and formalised it through this project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I conducted some initial research by watching lectures from university courses such as MIT, as well as conferences displaying bleeding edge technology such as Google Cloud. With a basic understanding and equipped with the sorts of concepts and fundamentals
                                that exist, I then began formally researching them through videos, news stories, as well as projects and implementations of the technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Neural Networks took a particular interest to me during my research. I learnt their fundamentals and mathematical operations (activation and loss functions), as well as the processes when dealing with a whole network such as backpropagation during training.
                                While looking at newly introduced technologies, I also learnt about a variety of the issues that are faced when implementing Neural Networks - overfitting, class-variability, vanishing gradient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Taking the understanding I had accumulated, I started to look at some practical work, building a simple classifier with the MNIST data set, as well as looking at how more complex solutions were structured and developed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the most interesting demonstrations I looked at was a 3-layer Recurrent Neural Network, that was being fed the plays of William Shakespeare. And then once trained, it was able to generate new scripts for any given length. It was able to not only
                                correctly format for a script with stage directions, but also generate new character names with the correct capitalisations and emphasis. When I displayed this running in real time at my presentation, it struck people with
                                a real glimpse into what the technology is possible of.

                            At Fire Tech, I was one of a handful of tutors running a summer courses in Cambridge with a focus on technology and coding. Together we managed around 25-40 children each week, ageing from 8-17 years old.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role involved the general running of the camp each day, as well as delivering and preparing course content to groups of size from 3-16.

                        Alongside my A-Level studies, I tutored in Mathematics and English from a 7 year-old level to A-Level Mathematics and GCSE English.

                    <p>
                        Each student was at a different skill-level, thus requiring me to personalise the curriculum to each student's ability and weaknesses. Additionally, I had to report and give feedback to parents and lead teachers, providing effective and actionable advice
                        for the child to improve.

                        <p>
                            During my first year of A-Levels, I was introduced to the Young Scientists Journal: A science journal researched, written and edited by 12-20 year olds. A fellow classmate and I decided to get in touch with the YSJ and organised our own 'hub' to create
                            a termly Leicester Grammar School edition of the YSJ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the organisation was complete, we presented to the school, advertised and spread the word about needing writers, editors and any interested parties. Amassing a sizable group of young, enthusiastic members with both STEM and non-STEM interests, we
                            created a heirachy of roles and pipeline of writing, editing and publishing to release a copy at the end of each academic term.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This involved organising several groups and individuals on different tasks, and actively seeking out reports and updates on the process, to keep in line with an agreed production timeline with the school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To further interest and exposure to the outside world, my co-leader and I presented at the Big Bang Fair, hosting STEM-related activites, companies and opportunities to 1500+ visitors from across the Midlands. We had a booth explaining the project, and
                            the organisation as a whole. This garnered interest within the school and spread to other instituions by talking to teachers and students from a variety of areas and backgrounds.
